Getting started
===============
To get started with the delayed reactant labeling module, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    (.venv) python -m pip install delayed_reactant_labeling

Each submodule has its own examples which explain how to use the introduced method.

#. The :ref:`predict <PredictExample>`  module explains how a prediction can be made of a chemical system in general, or for a DRL experiment.
# .The :ref:`optimize <OptimizeExample>` module explains how to optimize the predictions for a system.
#. The :ref:`visualize <VisualizeExample>` module contains many functionalities to visualize the data.
