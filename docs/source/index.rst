Delayed-reactant-labeling
=========================
**Delayed Reactant Labeling** (DRL) is a method which allows kinetic information to be
extracted from experiments on a mass spectrometer. This package allows for easy analysis
of such experimental data.

To get started check out the :doc:`installation` section for further information.

To create a prediction of the concentration of each chemical as a function of time the
:class:`predict.DRL` class can be used.
