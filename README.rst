Delayed Reactant labeling
=========================

**Delayed Reactant Labeling** (DRL) is a method which allows kinetic information to be extracted from experiments on a
mass spectrometer. By coupling the mass spectrometer to a TIMS unit, also different diastereomers can be modeled.

This module can:
i) extract the rate equations of a chemical system from the reaction steps,
ii) model the rate equations using a Radau ODE solver, to ensure accuracy and efficiency of the model,
iii) use the Nelder-Mead algorithm with adapted parameters to find an optimal solution in a highly dimensional space,
iv) perform multiple analyses of a system from different starting positions and,
v) visualize the model in different ways.

Detailed documentation is available in the docs/build/html folder, which can be downloaded. The html files can be
opened in any browser.
